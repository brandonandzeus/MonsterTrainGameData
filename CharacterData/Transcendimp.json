    "When a demon dies under the weight of their horns, they are reborn as impish infants, restarting their molting cycle. These imps are quite possibly the most powerful Hellhorned in existence - seeing all that has come before and all that will come after. While this power is lost upon their first molting, they've been crucial in my research of their Ring."
