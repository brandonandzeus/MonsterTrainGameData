    "These Reformed attendants of the Votive Houses are some of my closest allies throughout the Ring. Their reduced stature gives them a natural affinity for the weak, finding them to be kindred spirits of sorts. Their sharp resin hands, however, make their embrace of these fellow souls considerably more dangerous."
