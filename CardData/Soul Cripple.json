However, no amount of clever words can write over the violent truth on which they live: Echoes need Souls. For a clan so obsessed with its own secrecy, those who will volunteer their souls are hard to come by. With so many Echoes breathing, the number of souls required to keep them alive is... unsettling. But I can no longer judge on these scales â€” that time has passed."
