    "I could not Judge anymore, the simple scale laid out by the Divines too reductive for my beliefs. Souls are complicated, morally ambiguous beings. Hell and Heaven arenâ€™t that different, each one having its faults, but also having its wonderful beauties. I am not proud of what I did, nor what came after. The only solace is that, at the time, I believed it to be right, and without that conviction we are all lost. Though, I doubt Seraph will see it the same way."
