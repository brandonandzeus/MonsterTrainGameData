    "There is no mistaking the lineage connecting the Wurmkin to the Bogwurm Titan, but the hard-shelled Kinhosts do strike me as odd residents of this place. Some discarded stoneform mentions that they were the original inhabitants of this Ring, once a verdant place, but were enslaved by the Wurmkin as Echo vessels. Stoneform claims this was a blessing to the previously languishing Kinhost, an elevation of their lowly status. However, these discarded records and dismissive rationales make me think them to be downplayed atrocities."
